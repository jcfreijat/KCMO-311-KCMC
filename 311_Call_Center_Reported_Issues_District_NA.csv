I have contacted them multiple times over two years now about the 15-20 feral cats being feed in our small parking lot by another tenant. These cats are feed outside the common door the food is kept inside the common door.  Two of the cats have broken legs and most all of them have horrible respiratory infections. They have not been taken to any vet. They potty| mate| fights| and spray directly under my living room| kitchen| and bedroom windows| causing my apartment to smell horrible| ammonia. I have heart failure and this is a horrible on my health| plus we are losing sleep because of the sounds. The cats have attacked my 15 year old ESA dog a few times. The apartment is having flea troubles because of the cats and the houses up against my apartment. I have had family members visit and the fleas are so bad they are bit several times coming and going from the community door. The cats leave dead animals in front of the outside community door for people to step on. Since the food is put out into the parking lot raccoons and possums come up| right up to the front door wanting to come inside. We are gaining about 5-8 more cats per year do to the cats not being fixed. I have been told by the landlord they will not being doing anything about it because I am the only one complaining. They have used my social media to troll me| I have never given them any of my social media information. They are using my public assistance and the reaching out I did to the BBB against me. I pay about 100 dollars more a month for the smallest apartment and three people who have moved in after me is paying less than me. Also it was said the reason my utilities are included is because I am on public assistance but that is not the case everyone has utilities included. When I reported the cats to HUD the office did not take my complaint any further instead the landlord and HUD gave me a violation notice. My significant other is also on the lease and they will not talk to him and they only text me never call me when its about business issues. The landlord also has charged me 500 dollars after 2 years of living at the property for my dog. I had my dog from since we moved in and the landlord was present during move in and so was the dog| she even commented on it. A year after moving here my significant other and I had to go to the DMV| we bought a vehicle| and our dog got separation anxiety and I was contacted about that and ensured it wouldn't happen again| it hasn't.  There is a dog presently in the same building that howls for hours on end and the landlord has been contacted about it yet nothing has been done about it. I got a call not even after an hour of my dog \""barking\"" and the other person gets no contact about it. Again I am being discriminated against by my landlord.

He asked why I was not at the meeting- referring to Monday 8th at Haines Construction with employees and City.  I let him know I did not know anything about it until I walked in the office. He informed me of the incident of one of his truck\u2019s having a Confederate Flag displayed.  He said that he knows what he was taught in school| and it was not anything bad.  I replied that it is \u201chighly offensive.\u201d  He corrected me and said he was told it was a hate symbol.   I agreed that it can and should be referred to as such.   I went on to say if people want things on their personal vehicles that is one thing \u2013 they will have to deal with repercussions| but it does not belong in any part of the business world.  He acknowledged that he did not know again.      I commended Rick for taking action of having it removed once he was made aware that the symbol was wrong to display.  He went on to say he approached his employee about his information given and asked his employee if he wanted to remove it.  It was up to the employee| and he was going to support the employee\u2019s decision either way.   I said times have changed since you were in school.  What about Black Lives Matter and organizations like NAACP?  He responded with what about white lives.  I said they matter as well but we have not been repressed into poverty.  There is not an organization for white lives because they have been more privileged. I let him know that where I grew up \u2013 small town \u2013I only had maybe 8 black students in my school.  Only one family lived in town and the rest resided in a small area about three miles out.  He said they should be.  I corrected him that it was a low income\/poverty area not a black area.   He said that they do not want to work.  There are signs everywhere for job openings.  I corrected him that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to work- it is not a race issue.\u201d  He said again \u2013 \u201cNo they do not want to work.\u201d   I told him that when I was in high school| I was with a friend to see her grandpa and it was dusk. She was shocked when she saw a man still on the street.  She was concerned that he better get off the street or he would be beat up.  I asked why and she replied| \u201cBlack people will get beat up if out after dark.\u201d  I told him how upset that this was still happening in the 80\u2019s.    He replied with good for them.  I took this as he agreed with the town. I asked about if he makes a comment to a female and she is offended and lets him know does he correct it?  He laughingly shrugged saying that he is sure he has in the past. He went onto say he is Hispanic and he does not agree with illegal immigrants coming into the country| so he guesses he is racist against that as well. I told him about conversations with my millennial daughter about the heightened racism.  And that she as corrected me when I have referred to a person with| he or she instead of they or them.  I told Rick that I am a work in progress but trying.  We need to all do better with not offending people. I informed Chad of the conversation on 8\/15.""|""Please provide the name and contact information of the person(s) who discriminated against you (if known)."":""Rick Sauceda  913-231-8584""|""Please provide the name and contact information of any witnesses."":""no witnesses""}""",05/05/2023 08:42:12 AM

Below that is a Park KC zone sign stating Zone 6359.\nAfter these two spots is the Valet section for the hotel.  \nThe Valet is actively telling people they are not allowed to park in these metered spots on nights and weekends| outside the hours of 7am-6pm M-F. They say it becomes a No parking zone| I presume so that they can charge for them as Valet spots.  There is no signage stating any of this and the signage at this location contradicts what the Valet tells people to get them to move and generate more income for the hotel. \nWhen I type the zone into my Park KC app| it says paid parking is not required at this time| refer to the posted signs.\nThis seems like a clear situation of Fraud by the hotel.\ncan you please advise me.""}""",05/17/2023 09:08:31 PM
